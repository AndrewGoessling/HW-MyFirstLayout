            <p>What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?"
                I'm afraid I just blue myself. Marry me. He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. I care deeply for nature. That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.</p>

                <p>No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.
                        No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it. Steve Holt! Marry me. I'm afraid I just blue myself. Really? Did nothing cancel?</p>

                    <h2>My Third Blog Post</h2>
                    <p>But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore? Michael! I hear the jury's still out on science. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you.
                            As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. Well, what do you expect, mother? There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence.
                            Marry me. Michael! Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. Really? Did nothing cancel?
                            
                            Across from where? I've opened a door here that I regret. I've opened a door here that I regret. Marry me. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right.</p>
